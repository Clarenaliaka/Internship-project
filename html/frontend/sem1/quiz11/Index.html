 <p>The web has become an amazing resource for free online <span class="pink">educational resources</span>. If you're interested in learning music theory but can't take classes in your community,</br> you can always turn to the internet for help. This can seem a bit daunting at first, since many online music theory programs cost money,<br/> but if you know what to search for, you can find plenty of free music theory material for yourself, your children, or the whole family.</br>Consider how much you already know
 Can you play an instrument already? How long have you been playing? Can you even read music? Your prior experience will have an effect on how much you need to learn, where you need to learn it, and how<span class="short"> "simplified"</span> it'll need to be.<br/>which is set up in a way that makes it very easy to see the notes and relationships between them and learn along with your program, or you can even try your hand at composing.</p>

<p>Many sites will offer <span class="taller">self-check quizzes after every lesson or unit of lessons,</span> and you can use these to see how well you're picking this up. You may also wish to practice in real life.</br> You can try transposing a piece of music to a different key, you can take up an instrument like the piano (<span class="color">which is set up in a way that makes it very easy to see the notes and relationships between them</span>) and learn along with your program, or you can even try your hand at composing.</p>
