  <p> <b>COYREP</b> has organised a team of medical professional volunteers (doctors and nurses) to facilitate delivery of health and medical services to the poor of the area.
Coyrep is operating a clinic at Suswa with a full-time nurse and a doctor who visits once every week.Currently, an average of 400 patients receive treatment on various illnesses including malaria, tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, HIV/AIDS, among others.Through medical professionals, referrals are made to established hospitals for the more serious medical cases.
We hope to improve the clinic facilities in order to provide a spectrum of basic curative, preventive and promotive health care services such as maternity, AIDS awareness and a laboratory.
COYREP services reach out to main slum locally named Deep Sea, and other poor settlement of the are .The inhabitants lack basic facilities, electricity and proper housing.Most families are single parent headed by women who are economically unable to raise adequate funds for supporting their families.Youth and children are the most vulnerable members of the society.Due to poverty, idleness and promiscuity,HIV/AIDS.</p>
