Certificate in Computer Applications.My career began in data entry and I moved up through mid-range and mainframe computing operations, to client/server and distributed systems. In the Spring of 2000 I made a career change from internal IS professional to consultant. This change was the best move I could have possibly made because it opened new opportunities and gave me a sense of purpose and strong desire to achieve. It has also allowed me to leverage my experience and knowledge gained in the highly disciplined mainframe world by adding to the body of knowledge and methods of the distributed computing environment.

  <p>Being a Modern developer,i provide frameworks that have strong baseline for producing interfaces and interactions that in the past required a skilled interaction designer to realize. On iPhone, for example, while it’s certainly hard to produce great experiences, it’s just as difficult to produce bad UI. On the Web, AJAX libraries offer very usable UI patterns right out of the box and greatly reduce the custom design and coding efforts required to build good online applications
