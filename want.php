<h2>What do these companies have in common?</h2>
<ol>
<li>They are mostly coded in Nairobi</li>
<li>They have 10K+ people use or visit their site monthly</li>
<li>They display "Made in Nairobi" as prominently as its copyright and links to this page</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<h2>How can we be added to the list?</h2>
<p> Anyone who has a Tech company/startup in Nairobi can 
<a href="form.php" target="_blank">submit this form</a> and expect response in about a week.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h2>What does "Made in Nairobi" means?</h2>
<p>This creates a platform where all tech companies including startups can be listed on one website
,This is creating unity and through clicking on the logo,it takes one to the companies website and 
can view company information. Over 50% of the front &amp; backend code for the website or application
 was written in Nairobi</p>
</li>
<li>
<h2>How do you verify that participants meet the "mostly coded in Nairobi" and "10K+ people" rules?</h2>
<p>For now, honor system. Maybe later, verification TBD. Violations will be made public.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h2>My company is based in  Nairobi but our technology is mostly made (coded) elsewhere. Can we be listed?</h2>
<p>No. Many great companies and projects are certainly being conceived and managed and funded in Nairobi,
 but that doesnt mean theyre made in  Nairobi This is for internet thats made in  Nairobi</p>
</li>
<li>
<h2>Why the strict mostly coded in Nairobi rule?</h2>
<p>Because tech is coded, so made means made. Made doesnt mean funded or managed. 
Like a shirt thats designed/licensed/funded in Nairobi, and made in China: Itâ€™s Made in China, 
not Made in Nairobi. Made means made.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h2>Is there a Made in  Nairobi logo that we can display?</h2>
<p>We dont have an official logo,
for what you should display on your site</p>
</li>

<li>
<h2>Whos behind this?</h2>
<p>This is a project of the <a href="http://www.ihub.co.ke">Nairobi Tech Meetup</a>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<h2>Whats the point?</h2>
<p>If Nairobi is to thrive in the 21st century, Nairobi needs to make more internet
 Thankfully and excitingly Nairobi is now finally making some of the best internet in the world (see list above).
 So lets proudly show ourselves off in the hope that everyone everywhere (including software engineers who dont 
 live in the worlds greatest city) know what internet is made in Nairobi.</p>
